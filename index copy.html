<h2 class="mt-0">About Us</h2> 
   The Mini Moon Project was found in 2019 by the project director Grace Kim when she first noticed a close friend of hers hastening to take menstrual pads provided in the church bathroom. She asked her why she was taking such large quantities of menstrual pads, and her response, shocked Grace. Grace's friend was left at the orphanage when she was three years old, and although the orphanage receives government provision in hygiene resources, there were not enough to be shared. Hearing how these girls consider sanitary pads, something that Grace had taken for granted, as a source of financial difficulty, left a burden in her heart. In fact, some girls refused to go to school when they faced a shortage in menstrual pads, due to the taboos regarding menstruation. She found that these same girls lacked sexual education and misunderstood the woman's body, which perpetuated the stigma around menstruation. Eager to help, Grace started to put her thoughts into action by creating menstrual kits to be donated to areas in need.

<h2>Our Services</h2>
                Eager to help, the project director was able to successfully support 30 menstrual kits and conduct a sexual education class about the female anatomy at the Yong San orphanage. Originally, the menstrual kit was going to contain menstrual pads; however, with the recent discovery of harmful carcinogenic chemicals in menstrual pads,  the alternative option of  menstrual cups came into light. Menstrual cups are not only economically and environmentally ethical, but also empowers young women, by familiarizing girls with their bodies (through the insertion and removal of the cup). Thankfully, the first session ended soundly, but hearing the news of African girls trapped in huts during their menstrual cycles led Grace to develop a new goal of supporting menstrual kits to those of teenage girls that are located in povertized areas worldwide. As a result, the Mini Moon Project was able to support 50 girls in Savannakhet and 40 girls in the Pokot tribe with menstrual kits and and establish a correct understanding of the female body. Nikita, a student in the Lao Vocational Center, expressed that she made great use of the menstrual cup. “We always have been using tissues or towels to clean the menstrual blood or just let it flow, which have been hindering our daily activities, like drawing water from the well or cooking food. Although at first I was skeptical of inserting something into my body, the comic book’s detailed information and the pastor’s safety approval intrigued me into using this cup. Surprisingly, the menstrual cup was very comfortable to use after I got used to its insertion and removal, it almost felt like I wasn’t in my menstrual cycle.”

		<p class="text-center"> To ensure that our menstrual kits have been delivered properly, even after the support of menstrual kits, we regularly check up with the receivers to confirm that we have been able to be an assistance in their menstrual cycle. As a testimony of our aid, Nikita, one of the members of the Pokhot tribe, will be explaining how the menstrual kit made a change in her life. Her message has been translated from Afrikaans to English. </p>

            <blockquote> As a part of the Pokhot tribe culture, we women are responsible to build clay houses for our family, draw waters from the well, and cook for our family. But, when we I am in 'that time of the month,' I cannot do anything for my family, because I was afraid the blood will flow out of by body while doing such housechores. (In the Pokhot culture, blood, especially menstrual blood, are considered unsacred and dirty.) When the pastor first showed the menstrual kit to me, I was scared to insert the cup to my body. It seemed unsacred. But, because of the pastor's detailed lecture about our bodies and the detailed visuals on the comic book, I became more familar with the cup. Contrary to what I expected, having to use the cup had significantly changed my life during 'that time fo the month.' Now with the cup, I do all of the daily activities even when I'm in my cycle. I am very thankful for such aid in my life.</blockquote><h3> Bharat <span>Receiver of the Mini Moon Project</span></h3>
